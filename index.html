        <p> Hello! My name is Jacob D. Rix. I am aspiring to learn the language of computers and software that accompanies them in order to create and modify unique applications. <br/>

            <br>I grew up in a small town south of Kansas City. Graduated High School in 2013, then continued my eduaction in Utah, at Dixie State University. Here I studied Business and Marketing, as well as attempting a minor in Music (which proved to be very time consuming). Instead, to fufill the musical drive within me, I joined a performing group called "Raging Red". This allowed me to sing and dance my way all around the world, including a 2 week tour through the Eastern Coast of China. <br/>

            <br>After I Graduated with an Associates Degree, I was quickly offered an oppurtunity to launch new store in Wichita KS. During the process of launching this new business, when we were ready to begin building the website, I discoverd that the most cost effective way to build one, was to do it myself. <br/>

            <br>Fast forward a couple years and the businses was sold to another owner. My interest in the retail/management side of the business had faded. My curiosity in the programming and development of websites and applications was prominent, so naturally, I sought out more knowledge. Leading me to the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. <br/>

            <br>I look forward to creating more over the next few months, and this page will be the home to several of these wonderful new creations. I hope you enjoy. <br/>
